Got it. I’ll draft you a **highly professional, descriptive, and technical README** that you can directly copy-paste into your repo. It will cover the **idea, methods, directory structure, usage, and analysis** in a way that feels like a research-grade project.

Here’s the proposed README content:

# AI-Powered-Interior-Visualization-Toolkit

This repository contains an AI-driven prototype for realistic rug placement in interior images. The project demonstrates how computer vision techniques can be combined to achieve seamless rug integration into room photographs for interior visualization. The goal is to simulate realistic placement of rugs with proper scale, perspective alignment, and visual blending with existing room elements.

---

## Project Objective

The task is to design a system that can insert rugs into provided room images such that they appear natural and visually coherent. Unlike manual editing, this pipeline relies on computer vision and AI methods, with an emphasis on automation and reproducibility. The focus is on experimenting with segmentation, depth estimation, perspective transforms, and blending to approximate photorealistic outcomes.

## Dataset and Inputs

The repository includes the following input files (provided in the assignment package):

* **Room Images**

  * `LivingRoom1.jpeg`
  * `DiningRoom1.jpeg`

* **Rug Images**

  * `rug1.jpg`
  * `rug3.jpg`

* **Assignment Document**

  * `visualizer_assignment.pdf` (problem statement)

These images serve as the basis for demonstrating the placement pipeline.

## Methods and Approach

The system was designed using the following technical components:

1. **Segmentation**

   * Segment Anything Model (SAM) is used to identify and isolate the floor region where rugs can be placed.
   * Rug images are preprocessed to extract their masks.

2. **Perspective Transformation**

   * Rugs are warped to align with the orientation of the detected floor region.
   * Homography-based transforms ensure rugs scale and tilt correctly in relation to the camera viewpoint.

3. **Depth and Occlusion Handling**

   * Depth estimation models and mask-based occlusion layers are used to determine whether objects (such as furniture) should appear above the rug.
   * This creates realistic interactions between the rug and room elements.

4. **Blending and Color Harmonization**

   * Feathered edge blending ensures seamless transitions between rug and floor boundaries.
   * Color and lighting adjustments help harmonize the rug with the ambient scene while retaining its unique characteristics.

## How to Use

### Requirements

Install the dependencies directly within each notebook. Both environments use:

* Python 3.10+
* PyTorch (GPU enabled)
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Pillow
* Matplotlib
* Supervision
* Segment Anything (Facebook Research)

The required packages are automatically installed in the first cells of the notebooks.

### Running the Pipeline

1. Open `high-resolution-rug-insertion-image.ipynb` or `rug-insertion-image-lowres.ipynb`.
2. Execute the setup cells to install dependencies and verify CUDA availability.
3. Provide the desired room and rug images from the assignment dataset.
4. Run the rug placement pipeline to generate outputs with perspective-correct, blended rugs inside the target room.

## Analysis of Files

* **High-resolution notebook**: Best suited for final results on provided room images. Produces sharper integration and more detailed blending.
* **Low-resolution notebook**: Useful for quick testing and pipeline debugging. Allows faster iterations on placement logic.
* **Assignment PDF**: Explains the problem statement and serves as the project guide.

## Results and Future Improvements

The current implementation demonstrates realistic rug placement with segmentation, perspective alignment, and blending. Potential areas of improvement include:

* More advanced lighting and shadow modeling for higher realism.
* GAN-based rug synthesis and inpainting for better floor integration.
* Interactive interfaces for user-driven rug selection and placement.
